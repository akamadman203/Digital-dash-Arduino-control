This project is to reverse engineer the Nissan 300zx digital dash from 1984 in such a way I can use it for a racing sim and/or adapt it for a analog dash 300zx. 

I am no expert this is the first proper project ive ever done so mistakes will be made. Please reach out if you know a bit about the dash and how to help me bring this project to life

This is a compile of all the info I have to offer at this very time so I don't need to commit everything to memory.
