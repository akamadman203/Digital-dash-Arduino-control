Yazaki
This is the brand that was used on the digital dash if someone knows how to get more connectors this would help me so much.

Black drive most component control IE speed, rpm, fuel, temp oil pressure ect
Blue drives the indicating lights on the top of the dash ie check engine, MAF, ect 
White is where the device gets powered from plus other unknown control I'm yet to discover.
